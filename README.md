# SupportVectorMachine
Support Vector Machine (SVM)  A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category, they're able to categorize new text. A detailed explanation of the theory along with the derivation is aviable in my notes, which is available in the attached pdf I recommend you to have a quick glance at the theory , However feel free to skip the derivation of optimization using lagrange multiplier if you are not familiar with it.  I made this note while listening to Prof Patrick Winston's Course on Artificial Intelligence Lecture 16:SVM If you have any queries on my notes please go though the lecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwhiWxHK8o 

Data Set Information:  This is one of three domains provided by the Oncology Institute that has repeatedly appeared in the machine learning literature. (See also lymphography and primary-tumor.)  This data set includes 201 instances of one class and 85 instances of another class. The instances are described by 9 attributes, some of which are linear and some are nominal.  This breast cancer domain was obtained from the University Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. Thanks go to M. Zwitter and M. Soklic for providing the data. Please include this citation if you plan to use this database.
